/* Chapter 2.6 Combined Assignment Operators

	--> the combine assignment operators combine the assignment operator with the arithmetic operators
	--> they are also called 'compound' operators
	--> consider the following statements i.e.
			x = x + 4;		// x will be 10
			x = x - 3;		// x will be 3
			x = x * 10;		// x will be 60
			x = x / 2;		// x will be 3
			x = x % 4;		// x will be 2
	--> for convenience, Java offers compound operators that simplify these statements as follows i.e.
			x += 4;
			x -= 3;
			x *= 10;
			x /= 2;
			x %= 4;
