/* Chapter 6.9 Focus on Object-Oriented Design: Finding the Classes and Their Responsibilities

	--> the first step in creating an object-oriented application is to analyze the problem and determine the classes that you will need
	--> the goal is to identify the different types of real-world objects that are present in the problem, and then create their respective classes
	--> one simple and popular technique for finding the classes in a given problem involves the following steps;
			1. Getting a written description of the problem domain
			2. Identify all the nouns (including pronouns and noun phrases) in the description; each of these is potentially a class
			3. Refine the list to include only the classes that are relevant to the problem
	--> the problem domain is the set of real-world objects, parties and major events related to the problem
	--> the problem domain description should include any of the following:
			> Physical objects such as vehicles, machines or products
			> Any role played by a person, such as a manager, employee, customer, teacher, student, and so forth
			> The results of a business event, such as a customer order
			> Recordkeeping items, such as customer histories and payroll records
	--> after identifying the classes, the next task is to identify each class' responsibilities - what the class should know and do
