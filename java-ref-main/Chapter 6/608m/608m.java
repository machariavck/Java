/*	Chapter 6.8 Packages and import Statements

	--> the classes in the Java API are organized into packages
	--> an import statement tells the compiler which package a class is located in
	--> each class in the Java API is designed for a specific purpose
	--> a package is simply a group of related classes, and each package also has a name e.g. the Scanner class is in the java.util package
	--> there are two types of import statements; explicit and wildcard
	--> an explicit import statement identifies the package location of a single class e.g. import java.util.Scanner;
	--> a wildcard import statement tells the compiler to import all of the classes in a package e.g. import java.util.*;
	--> using a wildcard import statement does not affect the performance or the size of your program
	--> the Java API does have one package that's automatically imported into every Java program i.e. the java.lang
	--> this package contains general classes, such as String and System, that are fundamental to the Java programming language
	--> other API packages include;
			java.applet - classes for creating an applet
			java.awt - classes for the Abstract Windowing Toolkit. These classes are used in drawing images and creating graphical user interfaces
			java.io - classes that perform various types of input and output
			java.net - classes for network communication
			java.security - classes that implement security features
			java.sql - classes for accessing databases using structured query language
			java.text - classes for formatting text
			javax.swing - classes for creating graphical user interfaces
