/* Chapter 9.1 Introduction to Wrapper Classes

	--> Java provides wrapper classes for all primitive data types; the wrapper class for a given primitive type contains not only a value of that type, but also methods
		that perform operations related to the type e.g. 'parse' methods previously used
	--> a wrapper class is a class that's 'wrapped around' a primitive data type and allows creation of objects instead of variables
	--> although wrapper classes can be used to create objects instead of variables, they are not commonly used; that's because wrapper classes are immutable and they are
		not as easy to use as variables for simple operations
	--> normally, it's not useful to create objects from wrapper classes; however, they provide static methods that are very useful
