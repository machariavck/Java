/* Chapter 8.2 Passing Objects as Arguments to Methods

	--> Recalling, when a variable is passed as an argument to a method, a copy of the variable's value is passed into the method's parameter
	--> when passing an object as a method argument, an object reference is passed
	--> that means the method can modify the contents referenced by the variable
	--> when writing a method that receives the value of a reference variable as an argument, take care not to accidentally modify the
		contents of the object referenced by the variable
