/*	Chapter 7.10 Arrays with Three or More Dimensions

	--> Java allows creation of arrays with virtually any number of dimensions, to model data that occurs in multiple sets e.g.
			double[][][] seats = new double[3][5][8];		// 3 sections in an auditorium, 5 rows in each, with 8 seats on each row
	--> arrays with more than three dimensions are difficult to visualize, but can be useful in some programming problems
